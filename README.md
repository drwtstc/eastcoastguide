# East Coast Eats
[East Coast Guide App Link](https://eastcoastguide.herokuapp.com/)

Four developers came together with a shared passion for food and travel, along with a desire to share eats from the US regions they grew up. They pooled their talents and expertise in programming to create East Coast Eats. With the launch of the app, users can create and review listings in a directory while updating and deleting the listing they have created. The developers have the satisfaction of knowing they have made their favorite places to eat more accessible for others to enjoy.

## The users will be able to:

A User will be able to view a directory of restaurants from two regions: Massachusetts and New York. They will have the ability to sign up for the site; at which point they can add a restaurant listing to the directory. While signed in they will have permissions to delete and edit the listings they create.
